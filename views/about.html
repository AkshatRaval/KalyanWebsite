            <h2>How the Exam Will Be Conducted</h2>
            <p>Our scholarship exam is conducted in three stages to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the candidates'
                abilities and knowledge.</p>
            <h3>Stage 1: Mains</h3>
            <p>The first stage is the Mains exam, which will be conducted online. This stage will test the fundamental

                move on to the next stage.</p>
            <h3>Stage 2: Advanced</h3>
